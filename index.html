                and materials engineering (2007) from the Indian Institute of Technology-Roorkee, India. He is an expert in the field of solar energy generation, especially, 
                with the third generation of solar cells such as dye-sensitized solar cells and halide based perovskite solar cells. He worked on cathodoluminescence 
                spectroscopy to unravel the optoelectronic properties of halide based perovskite materials. Dr. Mulmudi also developed cross-sectional nanoindentation 
                technique to evaluate the fracture toughness of single and multi-junction photovoltaic devices at the Australian National University, Canberra. His research 
                highlights include the first demonstration of a low-temperature, solution based processing of flexible solid state perovskite solar cells
                 (Chemical Communications 49 (94), 11089-11091) and also stable lead-free inorganic perovskite solar cell (Advanced Materials 26 (41), 7122-7127). 
                 He has published over 35 internationally acclaimed peer-reviewed journals, filed a provisional patent with IP Australia (IP right number: 2018902843) and
                  has co-authored a book titled ‘Perovskite Solar cells: Technology and Practices’. He delivered lectures on photovoltaic technologies as a casual academic at

                Andreas studied physics at the Philipps-Universität Marburg, Germany, and at the University of Alberta, Canada. In his Diploma thesis, he worked on a monolithically
                 grown inorganic laser system on silicon. For his PhD in electrical engineering, he worked on organic semiconductors at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany. 
                 In particular, he focused on charge-transfer states in organic solar cells. To enable scientific exchange and ideas, Dr. Arndt visited the Victoria University of Wellington
                  as an Associate. As a scientific associate at KIT he also collaborated with a number of partners form industry, for example he worked with the German chemical company (BASF)
                   providing them advice on formulations for developing perovskite solar cells. Besides his work in academia, Dr. Arndt obtained a MBA fundamentals certificate from Hector 
                   School at KIT. The MBA training has enabled him to address, manage and build small start-ups and run businesses in the technology sector. Finally, he has decided to start
                    his career path in the field of intellectual property (IP) and works as a patent attorney's trainee in an IP firm in Hamburg, Germany.</h1>
